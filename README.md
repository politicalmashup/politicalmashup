# Political Mashup Project

This is the landing page for the Political Mashup Projects.  What started as a hallway conversation and a pilot project, grew into a series of projects and collaborations over more than a decade.  The Political Mashup Projects has been funded with a stream of projects since 2008 until today.  Its approach, its data schema, its tools, and its data have been widely used by other researchers and projects.
